[Vintage Cars](https://cars-vintage-project.herokuapp.com/)

### Project

My main purpose for this website is to catalogue information about various vintage car makes, from the most popular to rarest, and even those that no longer exist. It’s for all those lovers and followers interested in various models and makes who want to share their knowledge on a regular basis. Name, year of production and picture are all included in the car catalogue available in the app. The aim is to improve the search for a model on the list and make it easier to identify.


### Project Rational

This app was created for the Data Centric Development project of [**_Code Institute's_**](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development course. The project scope was to create a web app using Python and a MongoDB, which uses **CRUD** operations to allow users to easily create, read, update and delete data from a database viewed through a web application.

This was developed as both a front-end and backend project. The technologies used for each are:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python, Flask, MongoDB
- Hosting: Heroku
- Database: MongoDB

## UX

### User Stories

The following user stories have been identified:

1. As a user, I want the home screen to be visually appealing and easy to navigate.
2. As a user, I want to be able to register easily.
2. As a user, I want to be able to login and logout easily.
3. As a user, I want to be able to add a car.
7. As a user, I want to be able to edit a car.
4. As a user, I want to be able to delete a car.
5. As a user, I want to be able to search for the exact car.
6. As a user, I want to be able to access this website from different devices easily.

### Design Choices

#### Fonts

- The font that was chosen for this page is "Architects Daughter". Its appearance matches the vintage style of the site.

#### Colours

- The colours which were chosen for this page are:
    
    - #80cbc4 - body background
    - purple - logo
    - teal - car card, navbar
    - gray - category card
    - blue - text login, register and flash messages 
    - #245079fd - card title, icon and buttons
    - rgb(82, 82, 136) - car card border
    - rgba(40, 47, 49, 0.8) - text shadow on navbar and footer

Used colours are in various shades of darkness and accents from Materialize colours.


#### Styling

The website has been designed to be clear, easy to use and adapted to UI and UX patterns. The site should not be a problem for the user as it is designed in an easy to navigate style. The selected colour palette is eye-catching and colour-matched to avoid overwhelming the intensity of the shades.

## Technologies Used

### Language

- HTML - standard language used to create this page.
- CSS - standard language that describes the style of HTML.
- Javascript - standard language for game functions.
- Materialize - The project uses the Materialize framework to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Materialize styles to my app, before adding my custom styles.
- Python - used as the back-end programming language for app. 
- Flask - used Flask, which is a Python microframework.
- Jinja - used for templating with Flask in the HTML code. It allow simpler linking of the back-end to the front-end.
- JQuery - used to simplify DOM manipulation.
- PyMongo - used as the Python API for MongoDB. This API enables linking the data from the back-end database to the front-end app.
- MongoDB - used to store the database in the cloud. The information displayed in the front-end app is pulled from the database store.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

Testing user stories:

- Create a new account(Register)
- Login to user account
- Logout from user account
- Use navbar links to move in to different pages(Home, Profile and Add Car)
- Create new car card
- Read car card
- Edit car card
- Delete car card  

### Responsive Testing
The project was tested on development tools in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and the responsiveness of mobile devices and Ipads was also tested.

- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5
- Pixel 2
- Pixel 2XL 
- Iphone 5/SE 
- Iphone 6/7/8
- Iphone 6/7/8Plus
- IphoneX
- Ipad
- Ipad Pro 
- Surface Duo 
- Galaxy Fold 

1. Testing was done on a http://ami.responsivedesign.is/, which has been used to see how the site performs on different devices and their viewports. All pages, links, icons performed as expected on all devices. I also used it to create the all-devices.jpg at the top of this Readme file.

2. My app’s responsiveness was tested in Chrome and Microsoft Edge on different size mobile, tablet and Desktop to ensure that the responsiveness worked and the site is functional at all sizes.

    - Tested on Desktop (My Pc)
    - Tested on Tablet (Ipad 7, Samsung Galaxy 7)
    - Tested on Mobile ( Iphone 7, Samsung A20)

3. Testing was done by the Slack community, my mentor from the Code Institute and my friends and family.

Testing consists of finding any errors that could reveal incorrect operation of the website during its use. The website was also tested on private mobile devices like Iphone 7, Samsung A20 and Ipad 7.

All problems related to the functioning of the site have been resolved.

### Functional Testing

In the functionality test, I checked that all elements are working properly:

- Logo link
- Navbar Links
- Search Panel
- Cards information after reveal
- Buttons  
- Flash messages

### Additional Testing

For additional testing, I created a few accounts from which I performed:

- Registration
- Login
- Signing out
- Adding cars
- Editing cars
- Deleting cars
- Searching cars
- Adding categories
- Editing categories
- Deleting categories
- Using links in navbar and mobile navbar

### Errors

- The first of the errors that appears from time to time is a "net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED" error in profile.html, cars.html and categories.html image replacement
   - onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='static/img/avatar_car.jpg'", onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='static/img/avatar_car2.jpg'" 
- The second error I noticed is in the Safari browser - when you want to choose an option in add_car.html and edit_car.html there are two menus to open.
- The third error was a spelling mistake I made in the env.py file and it didn`t work as it should. 

ERROR During my last session with my mentor I asked him about the L05  (5.2)  assessment criteria and he told me I needed to delete the env.py file, which I did, and after that I can't open the live preview of the page in Heroku. I tried to fix it for a few hours with no success. I have to submit the project now due to the deadline.
FIX ERROR by the command line window in GitHub, I used config:set to add KEY to MONGO_URI again. The key was the same as before, but previously Heroku could not see it. After the configuration everything started working properly.

### Code Validation

- I used the [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML code.
- I used the [W3C CSS Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code.
- I used the [JSHint Validator tool](https://jshint.com/) to validate my JavaScript syntax.
- I used the [Pep8 Online tool](http://pep8online.com/) to validate my Python syntax.

## Deployment

I used GitHub for my version control and Heroku to host the live version of my project. To deploy my website to Heroku, I used the following steps:

1. Created the app in Heroku.
2. Run the `npm install heroku` command in the terminal window to instal heroku in my local workspace.
3. Ran the `heroku login -i` command in the terminal window and entered my credentials to login to Heroku.
4. Added and committed the files to Git using the `git add .` and `git commit -m ""` commands in the terminal window.
5. Linked the Heroku app as the remote main branch using the following command in the terminal window:

    ```git remote -v <app-name>```
    ```git remote add <app-name>```
    ```git remote add <link-name>```
    ```git push -u heroku main```

6. Created a requirements.txt file using the following command in the terminal window:

    ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```

7. Created a Procfile using the following command in the terminal window:

    ```echo web: python <fileName.py> > Procfile```

8. Entered the following Config Var in Heroku:

    ```MONGO_URI : <link to MongoDB>```


The app was successfully deployed to Heroku at this stage.
